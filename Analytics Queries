Below are several example queries that join your tables and use analytical functions to provide insights into your EV data. You can adjust these examples as needed.

### 1. Average Energy Consumption by Region

This query joins **Charging_Sessions** with **Charging_Stations** and **Regions** to calculate the total and average energy consumed per region. It gives you a sense of how much charging is happening in each area.

SELECT 
    r.RegionName,
    COUNT(cs.SessionID) AS SessionCount,
    AVG(cs.EnergyConsumed) AS AvgEnergyConsumed,
    SUM(cs.EnergyConsumed) AS TotalEnergyConsumed
FROM Charging_Sessions cs
JOIN Charging_Stations st ON cs.StationID = st.StationID
JOIN Regions r ON st.RegionID = r.RegionID
GROUP BY r.RegionName;

### 2. Monthly EV Registration Trends with Cumulative Totals

This query aggregates EV registrations by month and uses a window function to compute the cumulative total over time. This can help you visualize trends in EV adoption.


WITH MonthlyRegistrations AS (
    SELECT 
        DATEFROMPARTS(YEAR(RegistrationDate), MONTH(RegistrationDate), 1) AS RegMonth,
        COUNT(*) AS RegistrationsCount
    FROM EV_Registrations
    GROUP BY DATEFROMPARTS(YEAR(RegistrationDate), MONTH(RegistrationDate), 1)
)
SELECT
    RegMonth,
    RegistrationsCount,
    SUM(RegistrationsCount) OVER (ORDER BY RegMonth) AS CumulativeRegistrations
FROM MonthlyRegistrations
ORDER BY RegMonth;

### 3. Ranking Vehicles by Number of Charging Sessions

This query ranks vehicles based on the number of charging sessions. It joins **Vehicles** with **Charging_Sessions**, groups by vehicle details, and uses the `RANK()` function to rank vehicles by session count.


SELECT 
    v.VehicleID,
    v.Manufacturer,
    v.Model,
    COUNT(cs.SessionID) AS SessionCount,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(cs.SessionID) DESC) AS RankBySessions
FROM Vehicles v
LEFT JOIN Charging_Sessions cs ON v.VehicleID = cs.VehicleID
GROUP BY v.VehicleID, v.Manufacturer, v.Model
ORDER BY RankBySessions;


---

### 4. Analyzing Charging Session Duration by Station

This query calculates the duration of each charging session (in minutes) and then computes the average session duration per charging station using a window function. This helps identify how long sessions typically last at each station.


SELECT 
    st.StationName,
    cs.SessionID,
    DATEDIFF(minute, cs.SessionStart, cs.SessionEnd) AS SessionDuration,
    AVG(DATEDIFF(minute, cs.SessionStart, cs.SessionEnd)) OVER (PARTITION BY st.StationID) AS AvgSessionDurationByStation
FROM Charging_Sessions cs
JOIN Charging_Stations st ON cs.StationID = st.StationID
ORDER BY st.StationName, cs.SessionID;


---

### 5. Regional Utilization: EV Registrations vs. Charging Sessions

This query provides a high-level view of regional utilization by comparing the number of registered EVs to the number of charging sessions. It joins **Regions** with **EV_Registrations** and **Charging_Stations** (and then to **Charging_Sessions**) to calculate a ratio that might help you understand usage patterns across regions.


SELECT 
    r.RegionName,
    COUNT(DISTINCT er.VehicleID) AS RegisteredVehicles,
    COUNT(DISTINCT cs.SessionID) AS TotalChargingSessions,
    CASE 
         WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT cs.SessionID) = 0 THEN NULL 
         ELSE CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT er.VehicleID) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) / COUNT(DISTINCT cs.SessionID)
    END AS RegistrationToSessionRatio
FROM Regions r
LEFT JOIN EV_Registrations er ON r.RegionID = er.RegionID
LEFT JOIN Charging_Stations st ON r.RegionID = st.RegionID
LEFT JOIN Charging_Sessions cs ON st.StationID = cs.StationID
GROUP BY r.RegionName;
