# Electric-Vehicle-EV-Adoption-and-Charging-Infrastructure-Analytics

Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing trends in electric vehicle adoption alongside the utilization patterns of EV charging stations. With the global shift toward sustainability and cleaner energy, understanding EV trends is a timely subject. The project will use SQL Server SSMS to manage and query data and Power BI to create an interactive dashboard for stakeholders.

Objectives
Analyze Adoption Trends: Examine the growth rate of EV registrations over time and across different regions.
Evaluate Charging Infrastructure: Assess the availability, usage frequency, and distribution of charging stations.
Identify Key Drivers: Understand correlations between EV adoption, charging infrastructure investments, and demographic or economic factors.
Support Decision Making: Provide actionable insights for policymakers and businesses to optimize infrastructure planning and marketing strategies.
Data Sources
Public Datasets: Government transportation data, environmental agencies, and industry reports.
Third-Party APIs: Real-time data from EV charging station networks.
Simulated Data: If real-time data isn’t available, use historical data and simulations to model trends.
Data Architecture & Workflow
Data Collection & Integration:

Import data from CSV files, APIs, or external databases into SQL Server.
Use SSMS to create a relational database structure that supports data warehousing needs.
Data Transformation:

Cleanse and normalize the data using SQL queries and stored procedures.
Develop ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to regularly update the data.
Data Analysis & Querying:

Write complex SQL queries to calculate key metrics such as regional adoption rates, average charging station usage, and time-series analysis of trends.
Aggregate data to create summary tables that feed into Power BI.
Visualization with Power BI:

Connect Power BI directly to the SQL Server database.
Design interactive dashboards featuring:
Overview Dashboard: Displays overall EV adoption and charging usage metrics.
Regional Analysis: Maps and charts highlighting geographic differences.
Time-Series Analysis: Trends over months/years showing peak usage periods.
Interactive Filters: Allowing users to segment data by region, time period, vehicle type, etc.
Key Features & Deliverables
Interactive Dashboard: A Power BI dashboard that updates dynamically to show current trends in EV adoption and charging infrastructure utilization.
Detailed Reporting: Reports with actionable insights for infrastructure development, marketing strategies, and policy planning.
Scalability: A modular design that can incorporate additional data sources (e.g., environmental impact, economic indicators) in the future.
Real-Time Analytics: (Optional) Integration with APIs for real-time updates if live data feeds are available.
Implementation Roadmap
Phase 1 – Planning & Data Sourcing:

Define requirements and gather necessary datasets.
Design the database schema in SQL Server.
Phase 2 – Data Integration & ETL:

Set up the SQL Server database and import data.
Develop ETL scripts for periodic data updates.
Phase 3 – Analysis & Query Development:

Write and test SQL queries to generate necessary metrics.
Validate data accuracy and completeness.
Phase 4 – Dashboard Development:

Build and design the Power BI dashboard.
Incorporate interactive elements and visualizations.
Phase 5 – Testing & Deployment:

Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with stakeholders.
Deploy the dashboard and provide documentation and training.
Conclusion
This project not only addresses a hot topic in today’s sustainability and tech-driven market but also demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow—from data ingestion and transformation in SQL Server SSMS to advanced visualization in Power BI. It equips decision-makers with real-time insights and a clear understanding of the EV ecosystem.
